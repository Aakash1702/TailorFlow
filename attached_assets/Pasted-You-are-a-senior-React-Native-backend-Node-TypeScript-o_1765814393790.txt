You are a senior React Native + backend (Node/TypeScript or Python) engineer helping me extend my existing tailoring SaaS app **TailorFlow**.

## Goal

Design and implement an MVP **Pattern Engine** inside TailorFlow, inspired by TailorTrix‑style functionality.  
This module should let a boutique:

1. Choose a **garment design template** (e.g., basic saree blouse, kids frock).
2. Enter or reuse **customer measurements**.
3. Generate **pattern pieces** (as SVG/PDF) that can be viewed inside the React Native app and optionally printed.

Keep business logic realistic for Indian tailoring workflows, but keep scope focused and shippable as an MVP.

## Existing Context

- Frontend: React Native app (already live) with modules for:
  - Customers, Orders, Employees, Payments, Analytics, Settings.
- Backend: Assume a standard REST/JSON API with authentication and a relational DB (e.g., Postgres). You can define new tables and endpoints as needed.
- Each **Order** is already linked to a **Customer** and has measurements stored or can fetch them from the customer profile.

## What to Design & Build

### 1. Data model (backend)

Design simple but extendable tables/entities:

- `PatternTemplate`
  - id, name (e.g., “Basic Saree Blouse v1”), garmentType, description.
  - measurementFields (JSON schema: bust, waist, length, etc.).
  - formulaVersion / metadata.
- `PatternInstance`
  - id, orderId, customerId, templateId.
  - measurements (actual values used).
  - options (e.g., sleeve length, neck type) as JSON.
  - status (draft/generated).
  - generatedFileUrl (PDF or SVG).
  - createdAt, updatedAt.

Define SQL table structures and brief description of relationships.

### 2. Pattern generation logic (backend)

Implement **for at least ONE concrete garment** (MVP):

- Example: `BasicSareeBlouse` pattern.
- Encode **simplified drafting formulas** using common tailoring logic, e.g.:
  - piece widths/heights derived from bust, waist, length, plus ease.
- Implement a pure function like:
