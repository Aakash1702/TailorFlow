helping me modernize my existing tailoring app UI called **TailorFlow**.  
The app is already built in React Native and uses a dark theme, but I don’t like the current colors, icons, fonts, animations, or transitions.

## Goal
Refactor the UI to look **modern, simple, vibrant, conceptual and similar in feel to 21.dev components** while keeping all business logic the same.

## App Context
- Tech: React Native with Expo.
- Screens: Dashboard, Customers, Orders, Employees, Payments, Analytics, Settings.
- Current dashboard layout:
  - Top: 4 stat cards (Active Orders, Completed Today, Today’s Revenue, Pending Payments).
  - Middle: “Quick Actions” grid (Customers, Orders, Employees, Payments, Analytics, Settings).
  - Bottom: “Recent Activity” placeholder.
  - Bottom tab bar with 5 tabs (Dashboard, Customers, Orders, Employees, More).
- Brand name: **TailorFlow** (tailoring/boutique management SaaS).

## What I Want You To Do
1. **Design system**
   - Propose a full light or soft-dark theme:
     - Primary, secondary, background, surface, border, text, success, warning, error colors.
     - Use a **minimal, vibrant palette** (1–2 accent colors + grays).
   - Choose a modern, widely available font (e.g. Inter, Manrope, Plus Jakarta Sans) and define:
     - Heading, subheading, body, caption styles (fontSize, fontWeight, lineHeight).
   - Define spacing, radius, and shadow tokens (e.g. `radius.sm`, `radius.md`, `radius.lg`, `spacing.xs`…).

2. **Reusable components (with code)**
   - Create production‑ready React Native components using the design system:
     - `AppTheme` / `theme.ts` (colors, typography, spacing).
     - `ThemedView`, `ThemedText`.
     - `PrimaryButton`, `IconButton`, `StatCard`, `SectionHeader`, `QuickActionTile`.
     - A simple bottom tab bar style that looks clean and modern.
   - Use a single icon set (Lucide, Phosphor, or similar) and show how to wire it in:
     - Example: `import { Users, Receipt, BarChart3 } from "lucide-react-native";`

3. **Dashboard screen refactor**
   - Write a complete `DashboardScreen.tsx` that:
     - Uses the new stat cards in a responsive layout (2x2 grid on phones).
     - Shows “Quick Actions” as minimal tiles with icon + label (no heavy borders).
     - Shows a simple “No recent activity” state using the new typography and icon.
   - Only focus on layout and styling; data can be static mock values.

4. **Animations and transitions**
   - Add **subtle, performant animations** only:
     - Press feedback on buttons/tiles with `Pressable` and scale/opacity change using `Animated` or `react-native-reanimated`.
     - Fade/slide‑in effect when the Dashboard mounts.
   - Provide small, reusable hooks or components for these micro‑interactions.

5. **Implementation style**
   - Use TypeScript.
   - Use functional components and React hooks.
   - Keep styles organized: either StyleSheet objects or `styled-components` (you choose one and stick to it).
   - Show all important imports.
   - Avoid any backend or navigation changes; assume React Navigation is already set up and just export the screen/component.

6. **Output format**
   - Return:
     1. `theme.ts` (design tokens).
     2. `components/` folder files for the shared UI components.
     3. `screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` with the new UI.
     4. Brief notes in comments on how to plug this theme into the rest of the app.

Start by proposing the theme and components, then show the full code for the new Dashboard using that system.
